# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework but my motivation to build this project was that this marked the beginning of a new start for me. I originally worked in the medical field of kinesiology as a personal trainer and wanted a career change. I built this project to get a better grasp and understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This project solves numerous problems as it helps me refine my problem-solving skills, specifically dividing big problems into smaller sub-problems that are more easily solvable. This project also helped me cultivate a developer mindset which teaches you exceptional problem solving skills, confidence to achieve anything you set your mind to and a positive attitude towards obstacles and challenges. I learned a diverse range of things from HTML structures, elements, class attributes, variables, arrays and 'for' loops to say the least.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
